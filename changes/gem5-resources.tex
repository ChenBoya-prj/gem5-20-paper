\subsection[gem5 resources]{gem5 resources\footnote{by Ayaz Akram, Hoa Nguyen, Mahyar Samani}}

gem5 resources consist of components used to conduct certain computer systems architecture
research on known-good configurations using gem5. They include anything from the configuration
files used to build a Linux kernel that works with gem5 to the configuration scripts that
describe the computer system to be simulated. The provided resources have been tested with gem5-20
and their working status and initial statistics have been documented~\cite{benchmark_status}~\cite{resources-repo}.
They could be used to do research with different system configurations. Moreover, some of the
provided resources could be modified per user requirements such as the working Ubuntu 20.04 disk-image.
One of the most important resources required by any full system experiment with gem5 is the disk-image
which has one of the most time consuming and error prone build procedures. The disk-images provided by
gem5 resources have been created by packer. We also provide gem5 resources to conduct experiments with many
popular benchmark suites like SPEC 2006~\cite{spec06}, SPEC 2017~\cite{spec17}, PARSEC~\cite{parsec},
NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB)~\cite{npb}, GAP Benhmark Suite (GAPBS)~\cite{gapbs} and Linux Kernel.
