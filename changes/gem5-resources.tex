\subsection[gem5 resources]{gem5 resources\footnote{by Mahyar Samani}}

gem5 resources are the set of inputs used to conduct computer systems architecture
research on known-good configurations using gem5. They include anything from the config
files used to build a linux kernel that works with gem5 to the config scripts that describe
the computer system to be simulated. The provided resources have been tested with gem5-20
and their working status and initial statistics have been documented. They could be used to
do research with different system configurations. Moreover, some of the provided resources
could be modified per user requirements such as the working Ubuntu 20.04 disk-image. One of
the most important resources required by any full system experiment with gem5 is the disk-image
which has one of the most time consuming and error prone procedures. The disk-images provided by
gem5 resources have been created by packer. The scripts used by packer to build the disk-images
are also included in gem5 resources.
