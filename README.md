# gem5-20 paper repo

First of all, I want to thank you for your contributions to gem5! Your contributions to the shared community research infrastructure has a huge impact to computer architecture research as a whole. Due to your contribution to the gem5 effort, I would like to invite you to be an author on the gem5-20+ paper. See below for what you need to do if you want to be included in the author list. If you don't want to be included feel free to ignore this email!

I am planning to post this paper to arXiv on Tuesday June 2. If I don't hear from you by then, you will not be included as an author at that time. However, on arXiv we can (and will) update the manuscript after that date, so if you get back to me late, you can be included on future revisions.

The canonical version of this paper lives on github: https://github.com/darchr/gem5-20-paper/blob/master/main.pdf.

Note that this paper is currently a draft. We're still working on finalizing the text, fixing references, and filling in a few missing pieces.

## What are we doing with this paper?

Right now, we will be posting a preprint of this paper to arXiv so people can start citing it when they use gem5-20+ in their research.

In the future, I hope to submit and publish this paper at an archived ACM or IEEE computer architecture venue. However, we have no immediate plans on how and when we will do this. I will contact you again when we decide to do that.

## Paper goals

As you are probably aware, we just pushed an ["official" gem5 release](http://www.gem5.org/project/2020/05/21/gem5-20.html). As part of this release, I am working on a new gem5 paper to advertise gem5 to the wider computer architecture community. In this paper, I am planning to include an overview of gem5, the changes in gem5's governance, and, most importantly, what has changed (including your contributions!) over the past 9 years since the original gem5 paper.

The goals of this paper are twofold:

1. Advertise gem5 to the new generation of computer architecture researchers
2. Give credit to everyone who has contributed to this shared community infrastructure

I think it is important to recognize *everyone's* contributions to gem5, not just those that contributed a large new model and published their own paper (which is great, too!).

Thus, I am asking everyone who has pushed any code changes to gem5 over the past 9 years (since the last gem5 paper) to be an author.

As you can see, we have already had many contributions from those in the community which contributed "significant" new features. For each of these, one or a few people have contributed a significant chunk of text which I have tried my best to attribute to the right person. Please let me know if I am wrong.

## What I need from you:

1. Any feedback on the paper. Please use the [github issues](https://github.com/darchr/gem5-20-paper/issues) tab to provide feedback (though a reply to email will be accepted, too).
2. An affirmative response to this email (Please CC both Jason Lowe-Power and Bobby Bruce) that you want to be an author on this paper with your author information (Name, email, affiliation). Preferably in the following format.

Per ACM/IEEE ethical guidelines **You are expected to have read the paper and "participated in the drafting and/or revision."** Before replying, be sure that you have carefully read the paper and provided any feedback. In terms of this paper, I personally believe that committing code or another significant contribution to gem5 counts as "substantial contribution to some component". However, I am leaving this up to every individual author to make the decision for themselves.

These guidelines are outlined below:

<https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/>

IEEE considers individuals who meet all of the following criteria to be authors:

* Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the article.
* Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content.
* Approved the final version of the article as accepted for publication, including references.

<https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship>

Anyone listed as Author on an ACM manuscript submission must meet all the following criteria:

* they have made substantial intellectual contributions to some components of the original work described in the manuscript; and
* they have participated in drafting and/or revision of the manuscript and
* they are aware the manuscript has been submitted for publication; and
* they agree to be held accountable for any issues relating to correctness or integrity of the work.

## Contributing to the repository

[This repository](https://github.com/darchr/gem5-20-paper) contains the latex source for the paper. This is currently a draft, but will be finalized in the next few days (before June 3rd).

Please use the [issues](https://github.com/darchr/gem5-20-paper/issues) to report anything in the paper that you think needs to be updated.

We are also happy to take PRs. Please do not create PRs that change more than a few lines as it will be difficult to merge them later. (I.e., no need to fix all of our references, we'll take care of that, but if you want to fix or add a reference to your paper, that would be appreciated!)
