\section{Major changes in gem5-20}
\label{sec:changes}

In addition to the systematic changes in project management discussed in Section~\ref{sec:current-gem5} there has also been innumerable improvements to the codebase.
This section contains descriptions of some of the major changes to gem5.
There are too many changes to list.
There were 7015 commits between when gem5 was released and the release of gem5-20 by at least 250 unique contributors.
This section is a comprehensive, but not exhaustive list of the major changes in gem5.
Along with the description of the changes in gem5, we also recognize the individuals or groups who made significant contributions to each of these features with separate by-lines for each subsection.
However, there are many unlisted contributors that were indispensible in getting gem5 where it is today.
