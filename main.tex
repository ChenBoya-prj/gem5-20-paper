    (A sentence about gem5 at a high level.)
    (A sentence about all the features of gem5.)
    The gem5 simulator has been under active development over the last nine years since the original gem5 paper was published.
    In this time, there have been over 7500 commits to the codebase from over 250 unique contributors which have improved the simulator by adding new features, fixing bugs, and increasing the code quality.
    Due to its popularity, the gem5 community has instituted a new meritocratic governance model to encourage community-centric contributions.
    (Come back to this.)
